    <h1>Pseudo Element</h1>
    <p>
        pseudo-element is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a rule, double colons (::) should be used instead of a single colon (:). This distinguishes pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements.
    </p>

    <h2>::after</h2>
    <p>
        ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.
    </p>
    <h3>CODE</h3>
<pre>
------CSS------

a::after {
    content:"&equals;&gt;";
}

------HTML------

&lt;a href="https://balu.dev"&gt;balu.dev&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
    <h3>OUTPUT</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <a href="https://balu.dev" after>balu.dev</a>
    </div>

    <h2>::before</h2>
    <p>
        ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.
    </p>
    <h3>CODE</h3>
<pre>
------CSS------

span::before {
    content:"&copy;";
}

------HTML------

&lt;span&gt;2020&lt;/span&gt;
</pre>
    <h3>OUTPUT</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <span before>2020</span>
    </div>

    <h2>::first-letter</h2>
    <p>
        ::first-letter CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first letter of the first line of a block-level element, but only when not preceded by other content (such as images or inline tables).
    </p>
    <h3>CODE</h3>
<pre>
------CSS------

p::first-letter {
    font-size: 2rem;
    font-weight: bold;
}

------HTML------

&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
    <h3>OUTPUT</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <p class="fletter">This is a paragraph</p>
    </div>

    <h2>::first-line</h2>
    <p>
        ::first-line CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first line of a block-level element. Note that the length of the first line depends on many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the document, and the font size of the text.
    </p>
    <h3>CODE</h3>
<pre>
------CSS------

p::first-line {
    color: red;
}

------HTML------

&lt;p&gt;
This is a multiline paragraph. Note that the length of the first line depends on many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the document, and the font size of the text.
&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
    <h3>OUTPUT</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <p class="fline">
            This is a multiline paragraph. Note that the length of the first line depends on many factors, including the width of the element, the width of the document, and the font size of the text.
        </p>
    </div>

    <h2>::selection</h2>
    <p>
        The ::selection CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the part of a document that has been highlighted by the user (such as clicking and dragging the mouse across text).
    </p>
    <h3>CODE</h3>
<pre>
------CSS------

p::selection {
    color: yellow;
    background-color: darkblue;
}

------HTML------

&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
    <h3>OUTPUT</h3>
    <div class="output">
        <p class="selection">
            This is a paragraph
        </p>
    </div>

    <h1>Pseudo Classes</h1>
    <p>
        A CSS pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s). For example, :hover can be used to change a button's color when the user's pointer hovers over it.
        <br>









        <h3>Location pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>
            These pseudo-classes relate to links, and to targeted elements within the current document.
        </p>
        <h3>User action pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>
            These pseudo-classes require some interaction by the user in order for them to apply, such as holding a mouse pointer over an element.
        </p>
        <h3>Time-dimensional pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>
            These pseudo-classes apply when viewing something which has timing, such as a WebVTT caption track.
        </p>
        <h3>Resource state pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>
            These pseudo-classes apply to media that is capable of being in a state where it would be described as playing, such as a video.
        </p>

        <h3>The input pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>
            These pseudo-classes relate to form elements, and enable selecting elements based on HTML attributes and the state that the field is in before and after interaction.
        </p>

        <h3>Tree-structural pseudo-classes</h3>
        <p>
            These pseudo-classes relate to the location of an element within the document tree.
        </p>
