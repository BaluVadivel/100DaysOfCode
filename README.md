### Why am i taking this 100DaysOfCode challenge?
Am taking this challenge to learn and take notes Everyday. Which helps to revise the learned things in future.*Once everyday learning is habituated, it doesn't end at 100 days.*

**Main reason :** Before taking this challenge i learned HTML5, CSS3 and completed [Responsive web design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/baluvadivel/responsive-web-design) at [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/baluvadivel "Balu Vadivel at FreeCodeCamp") (checkout [BaluVadivel/FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/BaluVadivel/FreeCodeCamp)). After this one month i don't even revised learned things due to *laziness*. When i realise that i need to revise i don't have taken any notes during learning. So that i am learning from scratch and taking notes everyday.
